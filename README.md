# Queue-Simulator
Creating a simulator for customer arrivals at a service centre.

➢Firstly, the simulation will display choices of Random Number
Generator for users to choose.

➢ The user needs to enter the number of customers for the whole
simulation and maximum number of customers allowed in the centre.

➢ Customers need to Enter any key to record their temperature, arrival
time, reaching the centre and departure time.

➢ Then the simulation will exhibit the message of arrival, entering the
centre and departure time of the customers from time to time.

➢ The simulation then provides the table of the service time for different
counters and the table of the inter- arrival time.

➢ The system we created will display the results of the simulation into 2
tables.

➢ Lastly, the system will evaluate the results of the simulation, for example
average waiting time, average time spent, probability that a customer has
to wait and average service time for each counter.
